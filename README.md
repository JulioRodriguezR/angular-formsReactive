# FormsReactive

Practicing reactive Forms in [Angular](https://angular.io/).
#

1. Project Name (should not be empty)

2. Mail (should not be a empty and a valid email)

3. Project Status Dropdown, with three values:

   - "Basic"
   - "Advanced"
   - "Pro"

4. A Password field (should not be empty)

5. A Submit Button

#

Add your own Validator which doesn't allow "Test" as a Project Name. Also implement that Validator as an async Validator (replace the other one). Upon submitting the form, simply print the value to the console
